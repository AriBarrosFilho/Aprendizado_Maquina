being there robert <REMOVED> is an amazing actor and now the same being director <REMOVED> father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for <REMOVED> and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly <REMOVED> was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also <REMOVED> to the two little <REMOVED> that played the <REMOVED> of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the <REMOVED> list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big <REMOVED> for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be <REMOVED> for what they have done don't you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life
